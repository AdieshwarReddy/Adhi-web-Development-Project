//browsers provide the runtime environment to run the code:
//Ecma  script,java script 
//Ecma Script  it defines the core features of java script 
// js is a programming language that follows 
console.log("Hello  coding world ");
console.log(2+3);  
console.log('Helloooo World');
let name ='Adhi';
console.log(name);
//variables Cannot be used a resrved keyword
//should be meaningfull

//cannot contain a space or hyphen (-)
//these are case insensitive
let firstName="Mogili", lastName = 'Adieshwar Reddy';
console.log(firstName,lastName);
let name1="PAcha";
name1="Pacha likitha";
name1="Pacha likhitha Sai";
console.log(name1);
//primitive /value types: Strings,Numbers,Boolean,Undefined,null
//Reference Types: Objects,Arrays,Functions,Dates,Regular Expressions,maps,Sets WeakMaps,Weak Sets
let name2 ="Adhi";//String Literal
let age = 30;//Number Literal
let isApproved = false;//Boolean Literal
let lastName1 =  undefined;//Undefined literal
let selectedColour = null;//null literal
//java script is a Dynamic type language because the values assigned to it can be changed at run time
//Java script is not a Static type language which means  it is not going to changes the value of a variable at run time
typeof name2;
// Object 
let person = {
    name: 'Likitha',
    age: 20
}
 person.name = 'Adhi';
console.log(person.name,person.age);
//Arrays
 let names = ["Adhi","Likitha","GAnesh"];
 names[3]="Sindhu ";
 console.log(names);
 console.log(names[1]);
 //So the objects in yhe array and length of an array is also Dynamic
 console.log(names.length);
//Functions in java Script
function greet(){
    console.log("Hello Adhi");

}

//Types of functions 
// in a real world function we use many many functions in fact 1000 function calls would be there
